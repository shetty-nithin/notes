----------NEXT.JS----------

1. Why?
    * Waterfalling: 
        When we go to a website, we hit the server and we get back an index.html file with js script with react code.
        Then we hit the backend server to get the user details and it will be render on the index.html file.
        Till this point there will be flash for micro second on the screen. This is not optimal and it is called waterfalling.

    * Not SEO optimised:
        While scrapping the website for the user for thier search, search engine checks only in the index.html file. It doesnt
        run the js file. Since index.html is empty, website will not be come in the search result.
    * React will not work in a place where js cant run. ex: email

    To solve all these 3 main problem, first render should happen in the server itself. This is called server side rendering.

2. SSR: Server Side rendering
    * The process of doing initial render on the server.
    * All the following rendering because of the state updates happens in the client side.
    * Can use other server components, divs and spans.
    * Can import libraries only on the server to keep small budle size.
    * Have complete access to backend.
    * Can read from a file.

    * Doesnt have access to browser construct such as local storage, window etc...
    * Cannot run hooks, doesnt understand states.
    * It redners only once on the server.
    * Lets use write HTTP backend rotue. Express.js is not required.

3. React.js is the subset of Next.js

4. Routing in next.js
    All the routes should be created as a file inside the folder "pages".
    Folder Structure:
    - scr
        - pages
            * signin.tsx          ---> /signin
            * signout.tsx         ---> /signout
            * homepage.tsx        ---> /homepage
            * courses
                - allcourses.tsx  ---> /courses/allcourses
                - mycourses.tsx   ---> /courses/mycoruse
            * api                 ---> We can write the whole backend here

5. How the initial rendering will happend from the Server?
    Along with the defining the function, if the any of the route has "export async function getServerSideProps(){}", then the control
    goes to this function before even creating the .html file

6. How to initialize the new NEXT.jx repository?
    * npx create-next-app@latest
    * It will ask for bunch of options. Select the appropriate.
